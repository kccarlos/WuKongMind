// MARK: - AppModel API for the UI (multi-forum)
//
// Forums (see ForumDirectory.swift for `Forum` / `SuggestedForum`):
// - `forums`                        every added/visited forum (published)
// - `pinnedForums`                  pinned, in the user's order
// - `recentForums`                  unpinned, most recently visited first
// - `AppModel.suggestedForums`      well-known forums offered before adding
// - `currentForum`                  forum of the current page, else the last one shown (computed from `currentSiteURL`)
// - `forum(for:)`                   directory entry for a site URL
// - `addForum(fromAddress:pin:)`    validates a URL/host via basic-info.json, adds it
// - `pin(_:)` / `unpin(_:)` / `togglePin(_:)` / `movePinned(fromOffsets:toOffset:)`
// - `removeForum(_:deleteData:)`    optionally deletes its summaries/chats/runs/watches
// - `openForum(_:)`                 loads its /latest in the browser
// - `recordVisit(siteURL:kind:name:iconURL:)` called automatically for detected forum pages
//
// Page and assistant:
// - `pageContext`                   browser page state (.loading/.notForum/.maybe/.forumHome/.topic)
// - `currentTopic`, `currentSession` topic of the page and its saved session
// - `isProviderReady(for:)`         a role's model can run (key present when required);
//                                   roles and model selection: AppModel+Models.swift
// - `agentSiteURL`                  forum the next agent run targets (nil → current forum)
// - `startAgentRun(goal:siteURL:)`  runs are scoped to one forum (`AgentRun.siteURL`)
// - `startAgentRun(goal:siteURL:completion:)` / `performAgentRun(goal:siteURL:)`
//                                   a run started from code (no panel, selection or draft
//                                   change) that hands back `AgentRunOutcome`
// - `cancelAgentRun(id:)`           stops a queued or running run
// - `askScope`, `setAskScope(_:)`, `sendAsk()` the unified Ask box (AskBox.swift)
// - `sessions` is keyed by topic key (`host[/basePath]/t/{id}`); per-topic calls take
//   `topicKey:` (`setKept`, `deleteSession`, `setInstructions`, `isWatched`, `unwatch`,
//   `markWatchedSeen`)
//
// Onboarding / hand-off:
// - `settings.hasCompletedOnboarding`, `completeOnboarding()`
// - `handle(_ request: IncomingLinkRequest)` share-extension / deep-link hand-off (deduped by id)
// - `drainSharedInbox()`            deliver the App Group inbox (also runs on scene .active)
// - `openShared(url:action:)`       open a shared link; "summary" | "chat" | "agent" | "open"
// - `requestAssistant()`            a hand-off wants the Assistant pane (`assistantRequest`)
// - `needsProviderSetup`            the role a hand-off needs a provider for (UI resets it)
// - `handleDeepLink(_:)`            forumind://open?url=…&action=…
//
// Ad and tracker blocking: see AppModel+ContentBlocking.swift.
//
// Post-level browsing (AppModel+Navigation.swift): `openTopic(_:at:)`,
// `focus(_:)`, `find(_:scope:)`, `next()` / `previous()`, `read(post:)`,
// `research(_:)` / `cancelResearch()`, `openLink(_:)`; the current list is
// `browseCursor`, page changes for the voice layer arrive on `pageChanges`.
